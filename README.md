# Procul
## Readme

Procul is personal project and tries to visualize Areas on a map which are at a certain distance to POIs. 
The result will look like a heatmap, just that the same color will mean, the underlying places have the same distance to a chosen POI. 
It will be possible to combine multiple categories and customize the calculation and colorization formula.
There also will be multiple possible distane measures such as linear distance, distance by foot, distance by car, maybe distance by train?

This project will be a one-man-project and i hope i can fulfill my ambitions as i have never worked with GIS or even programmed javascript.
