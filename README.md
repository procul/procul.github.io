# Procul
## Readme

Procul is personal project of mine and tries to visualize Areas on a map which are at a certain distance to POIs. 
The result will look like a heatmap, just that the same color will mean that the underlying places have the same distance to a chosen Group of POIs. 
It will be possible to combine multiple categories and customize the calculation and colorization formula.
There also will be multiple possible distance measures such as linear distance, distance by foot, distance by car, maybe distance by public transit?

This project will be a one-man-project and i hope i can fulfill my ambitions as i have never worked with GIS or even programmed javascript.

## Status

There is currently no working version and i'm researching a few things like existing libraries etc.
